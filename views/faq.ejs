        <p>
          Puberty is the stage of human development during which physical and
          sexual characteristics mature, and a person becomes capable of
          reproduction. It is triggered by hormonal changes in the body and
          typically occurs between the ages of 8 and 14 in girls and 9 and 16 in
          boys.

        <h3>How do hormones affect our bodies during puberty?</h3>
        <p>
          Hormones play a key role in the physical changes that occur during
          puberty. In girls, estrogen is responsible for breast development and
          menstruation, while in boys, testosterone is responsible for the
          growth of facial and body hair, muscle development, and deepening of
          the voice.

        <h3>What is menstruation and how does it work?</h3>
        <p>
          Menstruation is the monthly shedding of the uterine lining in females.
          It is a natural process that occurs in females who have reached
          puberty and is necessary for pregnancy. The menstrual cycle is
          controlled by hormones, and on average lasts for 28 days.

        <h3>What is consent and why is it important?</h3>
        <p>
          Consent is an agreement between two people to engage in sexual
          activity. It is important because it ensures that all parties involved
          are willing and enthusiastic participants, and helps prevent sexual
          assault or other non-consensual sexual experiences.
